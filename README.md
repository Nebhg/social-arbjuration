Social Arbjuration FastAPI & Selenium Project
This project demonstrates the use of FastAPI and Selenium within Docker containers for web scraping tasks. It's structured to allow for easy development and deployment, leveraging Docker Compose for service orchestration.

Project Structure
app/: Contains the FastAPI application code.
scraper.py: Module for web scraping logic using Selenium.
main.py: FastAPI app initialization and API route definitions.
Dockerfile: Instructions for building the FastAPI application Docker image.
docker-compose.yml: Defines the services, networks, and volumes for running the application and Selenium server in Docker.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python package dependencies for the application.
Prerequisites
Docker: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. For Windows users, Docker Desktop is recommended.
WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux): Recommended for Windows users to manage Docker and project files.
Setup & Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://yourrepository.git social-arbjuration
cd social-arbjuration
Build and Run with Docker Compose

From the root of the project directory, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command builds the FastAPI application image, starts the Selenium server, and ensures the services are networked together.

Usage
Once the services are up and running, the FastAPI application will be accessible at http://localhost.

Triggering a Web Scraping Task
To initiate a web scraping task, send a GET request to the /scrape endpoint with the target URL as a query parameter:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost/scrape?url=https://example.com
This request will instruct the FastAPI application to use Selenium for scraping the specified URL and return relevant data, such as the page title, in the response.

Development
Live Code Updates: The FastAPI application is set up with a Docker volume that mounts the project directory into the container. This setup allows for live updates to the application code without needing to rebuild the Docker image.
Debugging: Use docker logs <container_name> to view the logs of specific containers for debugging. Replace <container_name> with either fastapi-app-1 or selenium-server-1 based on which service's logs you want to inspect.
Maintaining
Dependencies: To add or update Python package dependencies, modify the requirements.txt file and rebuild the Docker image.
Upgrades: Regularly check for updates to FastAPI, Selenium, and the base Docker images to keep the project up-to-date with the latest improvements and security patches.
